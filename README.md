# Hugo Theme lumostone

> It's a modification of [Zozo](https://github.com/varkai/hugo-theme-zozo).
> TOC functionality and style are borrowed from [Minos](https://github.com/carsonip/hugo-theme-minos).
> Tabs functionality is inspired by [Hugo Dynamic Tabs](https://github.com/rvanhorn/hugo-dynamic-tabs) and [Marina Meier's comment](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/code-tabs-widget/975/7), and customized for this theme.
